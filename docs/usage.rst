Viewing/previewing
------------------

The views provided will only display the published version by default. To preview the draft version, either follow the preview link from the admin, or append ``?edit`` at the end of the URL (note that you will need to be logged in).

Publishing/unpublishing
-----------------------

Press the "publish draft" button from an edit page to make your model public. If the model has been published, there will also be an "unpublished" button.

By default, the listing page displays a checkbox to quickly publish/unpublished models. The "Last changes" column highlights wether or not there's unpublished changes. Clicking on the button in that column will publish the changes.

Discarding changes
-------------------

If you are unhappy with the new draft, use the revert button to discard your draft changes.
